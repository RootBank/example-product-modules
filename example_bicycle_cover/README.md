# Example Bicycle Cover - Root product module template

Hey there ðŸ‘‹

This is a template product to help you get started. You can change any of this product module's features and configurations to create, test and launch your own insurance solution. Some features are optional and can be removed, if required.

If you're not yet familiar with building insurance products on Root, we recommend that you start with the [Dinosure tutorial](https://docs.rootplatform.com/docs/workbench-setup).

Root has extensive guides on how to build and configure product modules. The following guides will be useful to help you get started:

- [Insurance on Root](https://docs.rootplatform.com/docs/overview)
- [Product modules overview](https://docs.rootplatform.com/docs/product-modules-overview)
- [Workbench](https://docs.rootplatform.com/docs/workbench)

As you begin testing your product module, you will also find it useful to refer to our [API reference](https://docs.rootplatform.com/reference/getting-started-1).
